# Consumption-based Emissions-intensity-data-for-NEM

This data-set consists of hourly values of regional-consumption-based emissions intensity for the National Electricity Market.

Consumption based emissions intensity is calculating by solving a linear system of equations to trace power flows from the generator source to the region in which it is consumed.

The model uses generator SCADA data from scheduled and semi-scheduled generators, inter-connector flows and regional demand data combined with static carbon emissions intensity factors for each generator-region combination.

The data may be useful for retrospective carbon accounting and reporting (micro or macro level).
