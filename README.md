# Consumption-based Emissions-intensity-data-for-NEM

This data set consists of estimates of the carbon emissions intensity of grid-consumed energy for the five regions of the National Electricity Market updated at five-minute intervals. Estimates are calculated using an energy balance model combined with publicly available generator SCADA data, interconnector power flows/losses and regional demand data sourced from the market operator. Generator carbon emissions intensity factors include Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions (and 2 for semi-scheduled generators only).
