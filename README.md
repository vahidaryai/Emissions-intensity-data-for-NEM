# Consumption-based Emissions-intensity-data-for-NEM

This data-set consists of hourly values of regional-consumption-based emissions intensity for the National Electricity Market.

Consumption based emissions intensity is calculating by solving a linear system of equations to trace power flows from the generator source to the region in which it is consumed.

The model uses generator SCADA data from scheduled and semi-scheduled generators, inter-connector flows and regional demand data combined with static carbon emissions intensity factors for each generator-region combination.

The data may be useful for retrospective carbon accounting and reporting (micro or macro level).


All data is provided as with no express or implied warranty as to accuracy, reliability, or fitness for any particular application.
